# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

We will meet twice a week for an hour. We will also try and meet on Thursday so that we can make sure that we have done everything we need to do for the week. We will try to meet in person but if this does not work then we will do a discord call. Nobody will take notes for the meetings. 

2. **Assistance** 

If we need to contact one of our teammates we will do so through discord. Teammates should respond within a day. 

3. **Respect** 

We will first try and get ideas from everyone and not shoot anyone down until we have gotten all of our ideas out and then from there we will try and come to a consensus about what to do. Every member will actively listen and engage in the conversation. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will try and create an API for the project and then each week we will pick parts of it that we want to do. Then each person will pick some of those components and it will be their responsibility to finish them by the end of the week. In our pushes we should say if our function works or not and if anyone can help, this way that all team members know about complications. Finally, we will make branches on GitHub and on our Thursday meeting we will merge them into the main branch. 
5. **Time Commitment** 
We will try to dedicate a minimum of three hours a week to this project. However, we would not be surprised if we must spend more time on this. If someone cannot work during the week it will be their responsibility to let the team know and to make up for more work for the next week. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If there is a conflict, we will talk it out. If the disagreement persists despite attempts to compromise, we will take a democratic vote. If this still continues, then we will perhaps go to a TA. If members have not accomplished their task, we will first ping them and try and figure out what is going on, if they continue to be unresponsive then we will consider contacting a TA. If one or more members are continually late we will ask them if there is a better meeting time.
